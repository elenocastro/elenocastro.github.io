<p class="first-p"><span class="first-word">I</span>n economics, monopolies, duopolies and oligopolies are studied a lot because in this case the market does not work properly. Monopolies (and their derivatives) occur when only one company is the only provider of a service or product in the market. What is the problem with this? Well, the company has the power to manage the price and quality of the product and since consumers have no other option but to buy from that company, they will end up consuming low quality goods at a high price.</p>

In politics this phenomenon also happens, in many cases few political parties are the only supply of candidates and unfortunately, even if you do not sympathize, you will end up consuming the product (that is, being governed by them.) In the case of duopolies like Pepsi-Coca-Cola, people still have the freedom not to consume.

El Salvador had for several years what I would call a political duopoly, in which two parties determined the supply of political officials (presidents and deputies). These parties could afford to elect officials who were unable to serve. This undoubtedly led many Salvadorans to feel disillusioned by the quality of politics in the country. In which one had to choose the least bad candidate.

This phenomenon is nothing strange, it happens everywhere, even in the most developed democracies. It is normal that two parties or at most three concentrate the majority of votes and that the candidates for officials are people with few qualifications. Usually the most relevant factor to be a candidate in this scheme is cronyism with the party elites and having a degree of internal support with the party bases.

Despite what many people might think, this two-party scheme has some benefits. Having two political forces with the same power allows regulating the balance of forces between the powers of the State. In other words, no party has the absolute power to do what it wants and must therefore negotiate. In addition, people who do not feel identified with the current party have a clear option and with a high probability of running for an important position in the elections.

However, recently in El Salvador the political duopoly has been destroyed giving way to what could be a total monopoly. The new party, Nuevas Ideas, seems to concentrate most of the powers after the next elections.

Contrary to what many think, less competition is never good, this will prevent having better candidates. By concentrating so much popular support, the new party will be able to choose less capable candidates who would end up being chosen out of inertia.

Additionally, concentrating power will facilitate the use of state resources in ineffective programs, the change of the constitution and higher levels of corruption. All this could happen without any kind of repercussion because no other party would count on electoral mathematics to be a tangible option in the elections.

It will not be enough to point out the errors of the administration if there is no party option with the possibility of winning or absorbing that social discontent. We are in the worst scenario where multiple mini parties will be deconcentrating the political opposition.

This phenomenon has been possible due to the inability of the traditional parties to respond to social demands and strengthen their party structures. They were unable to see the discontent in their voters and to democratize their party.

There is still time for people to recognize that the new political order is not convenient for improving democracy and the country's institutions. Power is not concentrated arbitrarily; salvadorans are the ones who shape it. Returning to the old forms of power is not sustainable either, the new political parties have the task of generating confidence in Salvadorans and being the competition that forces Nuevas Ideas to improve.
